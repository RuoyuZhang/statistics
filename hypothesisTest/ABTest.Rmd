##Test whether a change have significant effect
* Control vs Trial
* Online AB testing, more data, but maybe lower resolution

##Example
* Creates online finance courses
* Customer funnel: large to small
1. Hypothesis: Changing the "start now" button from orange to pink will increase how many students (click through probability) explore the courses
2. Choose metric: 
    + (Number of click)/(Number of page views): click-through-rate
    + (Uniq visitors who click)/(Unique visitors to page): click-through probability

##Distributions:
* Binomial distribution: 2 outcomes; iid
* Confidence Interval: $N*\hat{p} > 5$ can assume normal dist; m = Z*SE; Z-score

##Hypothesis Testing:
p(results due to chance)
* Null hypothesis:Pcontrol = Pexperiment
* Alternative hypothesis: Pcont != Pexp
* Reject Null hypothesis if P < 0.05

##Size and Power:
* Small sample: $\alpha$ is low, $\beta$ is high
