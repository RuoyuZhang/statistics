### T-test

1. Two samples come from same population
2. A sample is drawn from a probability distribution
* Null hypothesis: $\mu$ = $\mu_{0}$
* statistic: t 
* assumption: Normal or almost normal distribution for sample
* 1. Equal sample size? 2. Equal variance? for Welch t-test 

```{r}
#t-test
a = 1:10
b = 7:20
t.test(a,b)
```

### Shapiro-Wilk Test
* test sample normality
* Assumption: samll sample (N<50)

```{r}
shapiro.test(rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 3))
shapiro.test(runif(100, min = 2, max = 4))
```
